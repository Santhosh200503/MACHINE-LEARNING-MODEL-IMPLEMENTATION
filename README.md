#This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify messages as spam or not spam (ham), fulfilling Task 4 of the CODTECH internship. Using the popular scikit-learn library, the code implements a complete spam detection system based on a real-world SMS spam dataset. The process begins with importing essential libraries and loading the dataset, which contains labeled text messages. These labels are converted into numerical values to prepare the data for model training. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.

A machine learning pipeline is created using three core components: `CountVectorizer` to convert text into token counts, `TfidfTransformer` to apply TF-IDF weighting, and `MultinomialNB`, a Naive Bayes classifier suited for text classification problems. This pipeline ensures that preprocessing and classification happen in a seamless, streamlined manner. After training the model, it is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy score, classification report, and a confusion matrix. Visualizations such as bar plots and heatmaps are included to better understand class distribution and model performance.

Finally, the model is tested with custom sample messages to demonstrate how it can be used in real-time applications. Overall, the project showcases a practical implementation of machine learning for text classification, highlighting the power and simplicity of scikit-learn for solving real-world problems like spam detection.
